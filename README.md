### [Calotix - Online Ticket Purchase Website](https://github.com/alfinnahuway/calotix)

Calotix is a full-stack project that allows users to purchase concert and event tickets online. Here are its main components:

- **Frontend**: Utilizes ReactJS as the primary framework for responsive and interactive front-end development. Vite is used for speeding up development, while Tailwind CSS provides an appealing visual design.

- **Backend**: In the backend, we employ Node.js with Express.js as the framework to provide a reliable RESTful API. This enables us to easily manage events, tickets, and user transactions.

- **Database**: We leverage MySQL as the primary database to store event, ticket, and user information.

- **Midtrans Integration**: This project has been integrated with Midtrans, a leading payment gateway service, for secure and seamless payment processing.

- **Separate Admin Panel**: There's a separate admin panel that allows administrators to efficiently add and manage events and tickets.
